Ok, it's basically working. Things to work on:

*Last level / error handling
*Javadoc / better commenting
*ui is ugly, both the code and the display/css.
*More themability
*More blocks
*More variety in rulesets
*Replace module-based quasi-singletons with true OO
*Richer set of actions and animations
*Cleanup of main.js - state transitions are sloppy
*Make sure there are no race conditions between ui, Phaser, and interpreter
