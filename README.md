These are just some experiments using
[Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/), a visual programming language
developed by Google. Things may get moved into their own repos as they
develop; right now the code is organized around my tinkering, rather than
necessarily being factored sensibly. Most of what is likely to turn up here will
be related to my day job as a middle school math and sometimes computer science
teacher.
